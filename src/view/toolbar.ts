/**
 * The two-tier toolbar of the ink note view.
 *
 * ## Why it looks like this
 *
 * contracts/design-brief.md is law here, and its "Layout must-haves" section is
 * derived from two GoodNotes reference screenshots Joost supplied:
 *
 * - **Tier 1 — the tool bar.** A full-width tinted bar (`--interactive-accent`).
 *   Left: document actions (thumbnails · search). Centre: undo · redo · add
 *   page. Right: tools (lasso · pen · eraser · text · shapes). The
 *   active tool is a light filled rounded square against the tint.
 * - **The Shape tool** (2026-09-21, from a GoodNotes screenshot Joost supplied,
 *   minus its width and colour): auto-shape, a divider, then square · circle
 *   · triangle · diamond · rounded square · star, a divider, then GoodNotes'
 *   two connector tools, line · arrow (added 2026-09-22). Auto-shape snaps
 *   whatever is drawn; a preset is dragged out corner to corner, a connector
 *   from start to end, and either tapped drops a default-size one. Last,
 *   Table: tapping it opens a rows × columns picker; the table is then
 *   dragged out like a preset and placed as ordinary ink strokes.
 *   Draw-and-hold with the ordinary pen is a setting, not a toolbar control.
 * - **Tier 2 — the active tool's options.** A floating rounded pill directly
 *   below tier 1 holding only what the current tool needs. For the pen: its
 *   selected pen type (with a chevron to the three writing styles), a divider,
 *   three stroke widths drawn as literal strokes of increasing weight with the
 *   active one boxed, then three quick colour swatches.
 * - Joost trimmed the bar on 2026-09-21: the page navigator ("1 / 1" with
 *   arrows), transcribe, outline, image, sticky note, laser, microphone, the
 *   add-colour `+`, the pressure gauge and the "…" menu (zoom buttons, dark
 *   paper, a second Clear page, the status readout) are gone. Zoom is a pinch;
 *   Clear page lives in the eraser's options. Pages are navigated by
 *   scrolling, the sidebar and PageUp/PageDown.
 * - **The lasso** (2026-09-22, from a GoodNotes screenshot Joost supplied)
 *   has no pill. Its button carries a chevron, and tapping it again opens
 *   the "Lasso tool" popover hanging from it: the lasso type as two cards
 *   (Rectangular · Freehand) and a switch per kind of element it picks up.
 *   The eraser's pill gains GoodNotes' "Erase highlighter only" (and "pen
 *   only") as one "what it erases" control.
 * - The pill's *contents* change with the tool; its *position* does not.
 * - Touch targets >= 44pt (`--gob-touch`). Every chrome colour is an Obsidian
 *   CSS variable; nothing here is hardcoded.
 *
 * ## What research/RESEARCH.md's pain points changed
 *
 * The brief requires that file's "User pain points" section be read before
 * touching this toolbar. Three things came out of it:
 *
 * - Palm rejection "is currently finicky" in every competitor, and Excalidraw's
 *   accepted answer was an explicit user-facing override. The pressure toggle
 *   therefore lives in the pen's own options pill, not in a settings tab.
 * - Shapes, images and OCR are the three most-requested, never-delivered
 *   features in the incumbent's tracker. They get first-class buttons — and
 *   each one whose model side does not exist yet is rendered **disabled**
 *   rather than dead, because a control that silently does nothing is the worse
 *   failure.
 * - Every competitor's ink drifts between devices. Page navigation and the
 *   "3 / 18" readout are chrome-level, because discrete pages are the fix.
