/**
 * The notebook's drawing surface: the part of `InkView` the pen touches.
 *
 * It builds the page stack and its canvases (backdrop, committed "dry" ink,
 * the "wet" stroke in progress), turns pointer events into the tools' work
 * — pen, highlighter, shapes, eraser, lasso, text — and owns scrolling,
 * zoom, undo and redo, the page counter and the diagnostics HUD. Files,
 * transcription and settings are the host's business: the surface reports
 * each change through `onChange` and the host decides when to save.
 *
 * What it puts inside the host element:
 *
 *   .goodobsidian-surface          position:relative, clips
 *     canvas.backdrop           paper, rules/grid, PDF rasters, page edges
 *     canvas.dry                committed ink, clipped per page
 *     canvas.wet                the in-progress stroke
 *     .goodobsidian-scroll         transparent overlay; owns scrolling + input
 *       .goodobsidian-paper        spacer that defines the scroll range
 *         .goodobsidian-textboxes  page text boxes (DOM)
 *         .goodobsidian-lock-badges  a lock on each locked picture (lasso only)
 *         .goodobsidian-image-ui   the selected image's frame, handles and rotate knob
 *         .goodobsidian-crop-ui    crop mode: the whole picture's box and the crop frame
 *         .goodobsidian-selection-ui  the lasso selection's frame, the action bar, its menu
 *     .goodobsidian-pageindicator  "3 of 18"
 *     .goodobsidian-hud            pointer diagnostics (debug only)
 *
 * ## Coordinates — read this before changing anything here
 *
 * `src/canvas/page-layout.ts` stacks the document's pages into **layout space**
 * at their intrinsic sizes. The view then picks
 * `scale = (surfaceWidth / layout.width) * userZoom` and scrolls. Pointer
 * positions come in as client px, are converted to layout space, and only then
 * to **page space** relative to whichever page was hit. Stored stroke
 * coordinates are page space and *never* depend on the window: that one-way
 * street is the whole reason this fork is paginated (see the coordinate-drift
 * bug quoted in research/RESEARCH.md).
