/**
 * The selection's action bar and its "…" menu, as data (0.5). Pure — no DOM,
 * no Obsidian — so what goes where, and where the bar floats, is tested;
 * `selection-bar.ts` draws it.
 *
 * After GoodNotes, from screenshots Joost supplied (2026-09-22): a dark
 * rounded pill floating centred above the selection (below it when there is
 * no room), icon-only buttons with a thin divider between groups, Delete as a
 * red trash can, and "…" last, opening a menu. That menu has a strip of
 * icon-over-label tiles at the top (GoodNotes' Cut · Front · Back) and then
 * rows (Copy, Duplicate, Paste, Lock image, …), grouped by dividers.
 *
 * Everything is one list of {@link SelectionAction} entries; each says
 * whether it appears in the bar, in the menu (as a row or a tile), or both.
 * Adding Cut, Copy, Paste, Bring to front or Crop is adding an entry.
