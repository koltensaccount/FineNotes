/**
 * GoodNotes 6's pen gestures, less the geometry of the scribble (that is
 * `scribble.ts`): the switches, and the loop Circle to Lasso reads.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no Obsidian.
 *
 * - **Scribble to erase**: scribble over writing with the pen to erase it.
 * - **Erase shapes and highlighter**: the scribble takes shapes, tables and
 *   highlighter ink too, not only handwriting.
 * - **Circle to lasso**: draw a loop round something with the pen, then hold
 *   the pen on the loop; the loop goes and what it enclosed is selected, to
 *   be moved at once. The hold is what makes it safe: a loop drawn round a
 *   word to mark it stays ink unless it is held.
