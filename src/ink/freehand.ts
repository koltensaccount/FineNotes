/**
 * How ink looks, as polylines the canvas strokes with round caps and joins.
 * Pure: numbers in, {@link InkRun}s out; the renderer makes the `Path2D`s.
 *
 * Handwriting is traced by {@link InkTracer}: the pen's points are smoothed
 * by a quadratic curve through the midpoints between them, and the curve is
 * drawn as a line of the pen's width. The tracer only ever appends: a point
 * the pen adds settles the curve up to halfway to it, and nothing before that
 * moves again. That is what writing in Goodnotes feels like, and what the old
 * outline (perfect-freehand) could not do: it re-derived the whole tail on
 * every frame (a lagging streamline, the last 3 px skipped, one point of
 * look-ahead, a start cap that turned as the stroke grew), so ink already on
 * the page bent into new curves while the pen went on. Against Goodnotes it
 * redrew 38% of what it drew, where Goodnotes redraws 1.5% (Joost's
 * recordings, 2026-09-30).
 *
 * The canvas's own stroke draws the line, which is one shape however the
 * line crosses itself. Tracing the outline here instead, as a union of
 * overlapping pieces, left hairline cracks where the browser's anti-aliasing
 * met the pieces' edges (4-10x the old outline's count, measured). A pen
 * with pressure draws in runs, each of one width: a new run starts where the
 * width has moved {@link WIDTH_STEP} from its run's.
 *
 * A clean shape is not smoothed: it is its exact centreline at the nib's width.
