 * Nothing here touches the DOM or Obsidian.
 *
 * A stroke's points are one flat number array, three numbers per point:
 * x, y, then pressure from 0 to 1. One array per stroke instead of an object
 * per point keeps a page of handwriting small in memory and on disk.
 *
 * Coordinates are **page-local**, not document-global. A page has a fixed
 * intrinsic size and the view scales it to fit, so a stroke
 * at (100, 200) on page 3 lands in the same physical place on a phone, an iPad
 * and a laptop. Nothing in this module may read viewport dimensions — that is
 * the whole reason pagination fixes cross-device ink drift. See PLAN.md.
