/**
 * Paginated wet/dry canvas renderer (DOM).
 *
 * Three stacked, viewport-sized canvases share one transform that maps **layout
 * space** to device pixels: `device = (layout - scrollY) * scale * dpr`. Keeping
 * the canvases the size of the visible viewport (not the whole document) avoids
 * iOS WebKit's max-canvas-dimension limits and keeps fills cheap.
 *
 * - **backdrop**: the desk and the page shadows. Repainted every frame; it is
 *   a fill and a few blits.
 * - **dry**: the pages themselves — paper, rules or PDF, placed images,
 *   committed ink — blitted from cached **tiles** (`./tile-grid`). A scroll frame draws only
 *   bitmaps; nothing is re-outlined. Tiles are rasterised at the settled zoom
 *   (a *level*), scaled while a pinch is in flight, and rasterised afresh
 *   once it settles. A missing tile is rasterised inside the frame when the
 *   frame's budget allows, or drawn from the page's low-resolution preview
 *   until it does; with neither, it is rasterised anyway — the dry layer
 *   never shows a hole where a page is.
 * - **wet**: the in-progress stroke, drawn synchronously per input sample for
 *   the lowest perceptible latency — and an image while it is being dragged.
 *
 * Tracing a stroke (`ink/freehand.ts`) is work, so each stroke's runs and
 * their `Path2D`s are cached against a fingerprint of its points: a moved or
 * re-pointed stroke is traced again, an untouched one never is.
 *
 * ## The coordinate contract
 *
 * Strokes are stored in **page space** (page-local, fixed intrinsic page size).
 * Each page has a box in **layout space** (`src/canvas/page-layout.ts`), and the
 * view picks the scale that fits layout space into the window. Every tile is
 * therefore rasterised in page space and clipped to the page rectangle — a
 * stroke that ran off the edge stays off the edge, and no viewport dimension
 * is ever written back into a stored coordinate. That one-way street is the
 * cross-device ink-drift fix the whole product rests on.
