/**
 * Pointer events on the page, sorted into strokes and finger gestures.
 *
 * A pen or a mouse draws; `palm-rejection.ts` has the rules for who does
 * what. A stroke's moves carry every sample the hardware took since the last
 * event (`getCoalescedEvents`, which the Pencil fills at up to 240 Hz),
 * mapped into the surface's space by the function the surface passes in;
 * nothing here knows the layout. WebKit's predicted samples are not passed
 * on: drawn, they made the ink swing (see `ink/freehand.ts`).
 *
 * Fingers scroll and zoom, through `FingerGesture`. The page has
 * `touch-action: none` because on iOS a Pencil drag over anything the browser
 * could scroll turns into a scroll, which cancels the stroke part-way; the
 * price is that the fingers' movement is ours to report.
 *
 * Two quirks of the iPad shape the stroke's lifecycle:
 *
 * - WebKit ends a pen it wants for a gesture of its own, a long press on a
 *   pen held still, in `pointercancel`. That goes to the surface as a cancel,
 *   never as an end, and the surface decides what the ink was (a hold).
 * - iOS now and then never sends the pointerup when the pen lifts and lands
 *   again quickly: the stem and then the bar of a "T". A pen-down that finds
 *   a stroke still open cancels that stroke before starting its own, and the
 *   surface keeps the cancelled stroke's ink.
